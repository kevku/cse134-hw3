        <p>Hey there, I'm Kevin Kuang. My fascination with all things technological led me to major in Math-CS, a dream I've had since I was a kid. Whether it's building computers or developing software programs, I'm dedicated to user friendly apps an integral part of our daily lives. My experience at <span style="color: blue;">University of California, San Diego (UCSD)</span> has been nothing short of transformative. UCSD has been the backdrop for my academic journey in mathematics and computer science, a field that has always fascinated me. It's here that I've had the opportunity to explore the inner workings of computers, learn from top-notch professors, and engage in hands-on projects that have deepened my understanding of this dynamic discipline. The academic rigor has been challenging, but it's precisely these challenges that have allowed me to grow, develop resilience, and become a more confident software engineer. Beyond my studies, I've also found a vibrant coding community, forming friendships and expanding my programming skills in a project based club. UCSD has been the cornerstone of my growth, shaping not only my academic foundation but also my personal and professional aspirations. It's provided me with a nurturing environment where I can pave my way into the thrilling intersection of mathematics and computer science, and I'm eager to see where this journey takes me.</p>
